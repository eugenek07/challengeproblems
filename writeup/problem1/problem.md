## Challenge Problem:
Design a secure Encryption Scheme and implement using Python to provide the Cryptographic Primitives
Required:
- One symmetric encryption algorithm
- One symmetric message authentication code
- One asymmetric key exchange algorithm
- One asymmetric signature algorithm
Write a description of why your scheme is secure and document any design choices you make
- Visual Diagrams/What attackers are you defending against? Are there any attackers that your scheme doesn't defend against? Did you make any choices for performance?

Alice wants to send a large file to Bob, how do they send that file efficiently and securely?
